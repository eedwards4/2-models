<h1>2 Models</h1>
Final project for CS480 at SSU.

<h2>Information</h2>
This project was created in order to learn more about neural architectures. To complete it, I built two models - a Perceptron model and a Neural Network.

<h2>To build</h2>
This project has the following dependancies:
<ul>
  <li>Python 3.10+</li>
  <li>Numpy</li>
  <li>Pandas</li>
</ul>

<h2>To run</h2>

```
python3 main.py
```
The program will display output for 3 training runs, each constituting a part of the project. For each part, the model will train for 1000 epochs and then it's accuracy will be evaluated.
<ul>
  <li>Part 1: A Perceptron model trained on the numbers 7 and 9.</li>
  <li>Part 2: A Perceptron model trained on the numbers 0 through 9.</li>
  <li>Part 3: A Neural Network trained on the numbers 0 through 9.</li>
</ul>
